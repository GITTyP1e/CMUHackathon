Resnik 4 CMU Hackathon Project

Our project is "Farnam Fitness Club"

We will implement three major features for our program:

1. User chooses from 3 dynamic fitness plans: beginner, intermediate, expert
and a profile will be created based on their initial weight, plan, and other characteristics.

2. Workout schedule is created for user and each day on schedule a specific workout plan is generated for user.

3. User will be given all possible locations on CMU campus to perform the exercises given in any specific workout.
